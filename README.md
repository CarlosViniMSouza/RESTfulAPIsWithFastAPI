 In this Python tutorial, you will learn about FastAPI, a Web framework for developing RESTful APIs in Python. 
 
 FastAPI is based on Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize, and deserialize data, and automatically auto-generate OpenAPI documents. 
 
 It fully supports asynchronous programming and can run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn
